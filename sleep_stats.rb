# This script will gather sleep times (duration and hour), average them over a number of
# days, and output a graph "sleep_stats.png" with both curves.
# The -l argument is used to set on how many days to average. Use 7 to average on
# weeks, 30 to average on ~months (it will average on 30 exact days), or any other
# value. The script will throw away all data before the first Monday and after the last
# Sunday, which is nice for weeks and not much of a problem for other periods.

# Possible improvements includeÂ : only throw out incomplete weeks when averaging
# over weeks, have a smoothed out curve instead of straight lines (as long as dots
# are still shown), show numeric values close to each point on the graph
